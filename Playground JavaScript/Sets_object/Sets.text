When to use Sets ?

- when you have unique or you need unique data

Ex if you try to add dublicates in a Sets object, he will not add them 

const set = new Set(["a","b","c"])

set.add("d")

OUTPUT:
console.log(set)
{a,b,c,d}

if we want arr :

console.log(...set)

[a,b,c,d]

set.add("d")

Set will not add again the "d" and the output will be again this:

{a,b,c,d}
